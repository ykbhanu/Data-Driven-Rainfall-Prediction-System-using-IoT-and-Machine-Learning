# Data-Driven-Rainfall-Prediction-System-using-IoT-and-Machine-Learning
The problem being addressed by the IoT based rain fall prediction system is the difficulty in accurately predicting and monitoring rainfall in different regions. Traditional methods of measuring rainfall such as rain gauges and weather stations are often limited in their accuracy and scope. Additionally, with climate change and increasing variability in weather patterns, it is becoming even more challenging

Many of the times we come across situations where we check the weather or try to predict the chances of rainfall the next day but the other day, we get completely contrasting results. Traditional prediction techniques do not ensure much accuracy as most of the methods are based on a particular machine learning algorithm, which may not be the finest of all.

Hence, to curb this problem, we have proposed to review the techniques for IoT based rainfall prediction comparing machine learning algorithms namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest to find out which one is the most algorithm for prediction. Finding out the most suitable algorithm for prediction can ensure accuracy in prediction making IoT based rainfall prediction more reliable and trustworthy
